            <p>A few words from Raymond Kerege, your Arizona real estate resource since 1984.</p>

            <p>I left the Chicago area after high school and arrived in Arizona in 1976 digging ditches. I quickly worked my way up to become the youngest foreman at Estes Homes (largest builder in Tucson in 1976) managing heavy equipment crews building master planned subdivisions.</p>

            <p>My real estate career began in 1984 and over the 3 decades in this industry I worked for big builders in new home sales, property management, re-sale and everything in-between.</p>

            <p>It all boils down to the fact that I am passionate about real estate and love what I do and there is no better feeling to see the excitement on my clients faces as we seal the deal, at the best negotiated price. Contact me if you're thinking about relocating to Phoenix, Carefree, Cave Creek, Anthem, Peoria, Glendale, Scottsdale as well as Tucson, Flagstaff, Prescott and Prescott Valley.</p>

            <p>Hiring me gets you dedicated focus on your complete satisfaction.</p>

            <p></p>

            <p><strong>And this is a fact....Hiring a Broker with over 3 decades of seasoned experience <u>does</u> matter in real estate transactions.</strong></p>

            <p>I began my search online wanting to move to Arizona and buy a home and Raymond Kerege reached out to me
              to offer his assistance. We found the home of our dreams and Raymond made that possible. We have referred
              our friends to Raymond as one of the best Realtors in the Phoenix and Anthem area and that is a
              demonstration of the positive experience we had with Raymond Kerege. Sincerely, <em>Janet and Martin

            <p>Raymond was the Realtor who sold our Anthem Country Club home. We enjoyed our time working with Raymond,
              and came to know him as a truly valuable asset to work with in finding the perfect home we wanted to
              purchase in the North Phoenix corridor of Cave Creek and Carefree, Arizona. Raymond knows the Arizona real
              estate market inside and out and is a true expert in his field. Raymond has always been an absolute joy to
              work with. Without a doubt, I confidently recommend Raymond when you are ready to buy a home in the
              Phoenix valley. - <em>Jerry and Gloria Pruitt</em></p>

            <p>Raymond listed and sold our home in Anthem Arizona at full sales price, he patiently helped us over
              several months look for the perfect home in Anthem and negotiated it well under list price and when we had
              to move my elderly Mom into an assisted living center, he immediately found the perfect family from his
              Bible Study group to rent it out for multiple years. Raymond went above and beyond and made the three
              transactions he closed with us, easy and smooth and he routinely made us feel more like family than
              clients. Thank you, Raymond, for all your hard work and for helping us find the house in the Phoenix area
              that is perfect for us - <em>John and Viviana Dunay</em></p>

            <p>I was looking for a second home in Arizona. My plan was to eventually retire in Arizona and relocate from
              out of state. Raymond made my buying an out of state retirement home a stress free experience. He sent
              listings faithfully and followed up immediately with any questions I had. He booked all the showings back
              to back and they were seamless and fun. Raymond loves Arizona and he knows the market well having sold
              real estate all over the state for over 30 years and he spent a considerable amount of time and went all
              out to help me get the home of my dreams! He is the best ever - <em>Kathleen Oliver</em></p>

            <p>We were looking to relocate from Northern California into our retirement home in Phoenix. Having so many
              criteria we wanted in a home, you never gave up helping us find our dream home. We were indecisive and
              difficult at times and you never gave up on us. Even after we purchased our home, your constant
              willingness to help us with anything we needed and checking in with us on a consistent basis to make sure
              we were happy is unheard of in the business and for that we are forever grateful - <em>Lisa and

            <p>When we were relocating from out of state to Arizona, Raymond was referred to us by friends who also
              purchased a home with his expert assistance in Anthem Arizona. There are so many aspects that set Raymond
              apart from other realtors. He listened, understood exactly what we were looking for and was committed to
              finding us a home that worked for both our lifestyles. Since we were not familiar with Arizona living,
              Raymond educated us on which features to look for and others to avoid. He kept us well informed throughout
              the entire process with no hurdle too large to tackle. Finally, and most importantly, we were impressed by
              Raymond's professionalism and honesty. Raymond was cautiously aggressive in finding the right balance for
              a fair deal. He showed us that he was the go-to Realtor when you're wanting to purchase a new home in
              Phoenix.- Regards, <em>Shelly M.</em></p>
